The Model class library seperates the models and viewmodels from the applcation to make the application easier to navigate for the next developer.

The Models allow the developer to iniciate the various variables that will be needed for each section of the applcation.
we can also specify which variables are primary, secondary and foreign keys whihc can interface with other models.
The models also will be used as Database entities.
After adding them to the ApplicationDbContext and running a migration on the NugetPacket Manager they will be added to the database
